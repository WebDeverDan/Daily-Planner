This application is a basic day planner. Set around the standard 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM workday, it allows for users to record their tasks for the day - according to the hour that they would like to accomplish it. 

There is also a color-coded system, based on the time of the day it is. If it is in the past (the hour has passed), the block color will be gray. If it is the current hour, the block color will be red. If it is the future (time of day yet to come), the color will be green. The text color for each is visible regardless of background color. 

Upon clicking the disk icon to the right of each text box,the task can be saved and written to local storage and will re-appear upon page reload. There is also an "Erase Notes" button at the bottom which clears the local storage. "Erase Notes" was not a requirement, however for ease of use this was added as an extra feature.
